# Adera
Adera is a smart medicine pill bottle system with an easy-to-use web interface.

It allows doctors to monitor their patients' medication usage over time by tracking the amount of pills in each bottle.
This helps determine if a patient is overdosing/underdosing or following their prescribed medication.
